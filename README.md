# Take Home Instructions

This take home exercise is composed of two sections.

1. One section is a working application that requires a code review. Code changes are optional.
2. A second section that includes a unit test suite with some failing unit tests. The goal is to make the code changes necessary for all the unit tests to pass.

The project is a very basic Java project (no maven, gradle, etc). 

## Prerequisites

1. Java 8 JDK
2. Eclipse (any version that supports Java 8)
3. Git

## Setup

To get started, clone this repository. In Eclipse, import the project and add JUnit to the build path.

## Section 1

The objective here is to perform a code review and come up with suggestions for the developer as to what should/needs to be changed.

All relevant code can be found in the package `com.companyname.codereview`.

If you wish, you can go ahead and make code changes.

## Section 2

Section 2 deals with the package `com.companyname.exercise`. Here you can find a JUnit test suite in the tests package. One of the unit tests is failing and it requires a code change so that all of the test cases pass.
